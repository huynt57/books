Photography is especially suited to this pursuit because the photographer can create multiple, distinct images of a single subject using a variety of design techniques. The display on a digital camera instantly shows the arrangement of elements in an image, allowing the photographer to make changes and refine their creation as they work.<br><br>Albrecht Rissler believes that a firm understanding of image design is as important as having an observant eye or having the technical knowledge to operate a camera. <i>Photographic Composition</i> presents the most important concepts of image design and offers 250 beautiful photographs to illustrate these concepts. By applying these concepts to your own work, you will greatly improve your photographic eye and your ability to compose an ideal image.<br><br>This book's impressive images are in black-and-white, intentionally removing the distraction of color and making it easy to focus on compositional elements and form.

In this book, Torsten Andreas Hoffmann explores an approach to artistic photography based on Japanese Zen-Philosophy. Meditation and photography have much in common: both are based in the present moment, both require complete focus, and both are most successful when the mind is free from distracting thoughts. Hoffman shows how meditation can lead to the source of inspiration.<br><br>Hoffman's impressive images of landscapes, cities, people, and nature, as well as his smart image analysis and suggestions about the artistic process, will help you understand this approach to photography without abandoning the principles of design necessary to achieve great images. Photographing busy scenes, especially, requires an inner calm that enables you to have intuition for the right moment and compose a well-balanced image amidst the chaos.<br><br>The goal of this book is to develop your photographic expression. It provides enrichment for photographers who believe that only technical mastery produces great images and shows how important it is to engage with your own awareness to act creatively.</p>\n                                            </div>"],"id":"9781937538538"},{"publisher":" Wiley / Visual","_type":"OreillyItem","ISBN":"978-1-4920-0791-3","name":"Teach Yourself VISUALLY Photoshop Elements 13.

But contrary to what many people believe, the best way to develop new skills isn't working on your weaknesses—it's identifying and elevating the underdeveloped abilities that lie between your weaknesses and your strengths. <br><br>Books like StrengthsFinder 2.0 have helped leaders build on what they're best at—but they stop there. If you only go that far you're missing a huge opportunity for professional growth. Leading Silicon Valley consultants Thuy and Milo Sindell argue that relying exclusively on your top abilities can actually hold you back—it's critical that you expand your repertoire of skills. The most effective way to do that is find your hidden strengths—midlevel skills that can quickly be elevated into learned strengths with attention and focus. This book shows you how.<br><br>Too many people waste their time working on their weaknesses, say the Sindells. Although focusing on shoring up weaknesses on the surface makes sense, they've found that it takes too much time and effort—the ROI just isn't there. The neglected skills in the middle, neither strengths nor weaknesses, are where the most potent development opportunities lie. They're close enough to being strengths that putting your energy there can offer a fast and powerful payoff. Us the Sindells' free online Hidden Strengths Assessment, along with the exercises and case studies in the book, you'll be able to identify your most promising hidden strengths and create a plan to turn them into major assets. <br><br>In today's work environment, not growing and stretching yourself translates into lack of innovation, stagnation, and obsolescence. You can't keep leaning on the things you're naturally good at or your strengths will become training wheels. But with the Sindells' help, you'll continually develop new skills that will keep you riding at the front of the pack. </span>\n                                                </p>\n                                            </div>"],"id":"9781626562837"},{"publisher":" Packt Publishing","_type":"OreillyItem","ISBN":"978-1-78528-882-1","name":"Intel Galileo Blueprints.

One reason is that people “jump to solutions” before they identify the causes of the problem. Performance consultants are effective because they partner with clients to clarify business goals and determine root causes for gaps between desired and current results. Only then are specific solutions agreed upon and implemented. <br><br>This third edition of the classic book that introduced performance consulting adds a wealth of new material. There are new case examples throughout and four new chapters providing detailed steps for measuring results from performance consulting initiatives on five different levels, including ROI. The book includes a never-before-published Alignment and Measurement Model, allowing you to connect organizational needs and performance consulting initiatives designed to address those needs with the appropriate level of measurement. <br><br>This remains a profoundly practical book, featuring tools, models, and checklists.

As president of MAP, John Manning should know. MAP has helped tens of thousands of top executives accelerate their leadership and management performance. Manning says the answer is one word: discipline. But for Manning, discipline has a very specific meaning. <br><br>All leaders have scores of things they could do. But a disciplined leader is one who identifies and focuses on the Vital Few: the 20 percent of activities that will drive 80 percent of the results. And the results that are most important are those tied to the organization's most precious asset: its people.<br><br>The Disciplined Leader offers fifty-two succinct lessons to help you home in on your own Vital Few in three critical areas: leading yourself, leading your team, and leading your organization. Each lesson comes with recommended tactics and practical “Take Action!” tips for implementing it, so there are literally hundreds of pieces of must-know, time-tested advice here.

In this timely book, Ira Chaleff explores when and how to disobey inappropriate orders, reduce unacceptable risk, and find better ways to achieve legitimate goals.<br><br>The inspiration for the book, and its title, comes from the concept of intelligent disobedience used in guide dog training. Guide dogs must recognize and resist a command that would put their human and themselves at risk and identify safer options for achieving the goal. This is precisely what Chaleff helps humans do. Using both deeply disturbing and uplifting examples, as well as critical but largely forgotten research, he shows how to create a culture where, rather than “just following orders,” people hold themselves accountable to do the right thing, always.</span>\n                                                </p>\n                                            </div>"],"id":"9781626564275"},{"publisher":" O'Reilly Media","_type":"OreillyItem","ISBN":"978-1-4919-1691-9","name":"Creating a Data-Driven Organization.

You will then gain hands-on experience by creating your very first wearable project, a pair of interactive bike gloves that help you cycle at night. This is followed by a project making your own funky LED glasses and a cool GPS watch. You'll also delve into other projects including creating your own keyless doorlock, wearable NFC tags, a fitness-tracking device, and a WiFi-enabled spark board. The final project is a compilation of the previous concepts used where you make your own smart watch with fitness tracking, internet-based notifications, GPS, and of course time telling.</p>\n                                                    <h2>Style and approach</h2>\n                                                    <p>This is a project-based book that introduces each project to the reader step-by-step.

In this essential title, Joe Kissell shines a light on OS X's many built-in shortcuts and provides sweeping coverage of the utilities that go even further.</p>\n                                                    <p>You don't need to be a programmer -- or even particularly geeky -- to automate your Mac. Everyone uses copy and paste, and most of what Joe explains can be used by anyone, from novice to expert, to make their work quicker, more accurate, and more easily repeated when needed. Nor is specialized software necessary, since OS X has oodles of built-in automation features like keyboard shortcuts, configurable gestures, and automatic launching of key apps. But clever Macintosh developers have created brilliant utilities that go far beyond OS X's features, and Joe discusses the key players, devotes a chapter to Keyboard Maestro (which gives you control over nearly any task on your Mac), and delves into the included automation capabilities in Microsoft Office and Nisus Writer Pro.</p>\n                                                    <p>In short, <i>Take Control of Automating Your Mac</i> will:</p>\n                                                    <ul><li>Show you lots of tools and techniques for automating your Mac.</li>\n                                                        <li>Offer concrete examples you can use as is or adapt to your needs.</li>\n                                                        <li>Inspire you with extensive lists of further possibilities.</li>\n                                                    </ul><p>We've included discounts totalling over $60 on eight of the key apps Joe covers: 20% or 30% off on Keyboard Maestro, LaunchBar, Hazel, Nisus Writer Pro, TextExpander, TextSoap, TypeIt4Me, and Typinator -- look for coupons at the back of the ebook!</p>\n                                                    <p>\n                                                        <i>Take Control of Automating Your Mac</i> has chapters about how to:</p>\n                                                    <ul><li>Develop an automator's mindset</li>\n                                                        <li>Use OS X's built-in automation features</li>\n                                                        <li>Take full advantage of input devices to save clicks</li>\n                                                        <li>Automate text expansion for faster, more consistent typing</li>\n                                                        <li>Control the Finder with a launcher and by organizing files with Hazel</li>\n                                                        <li>Supercharge your clipboard to remember and reformat previous copies</li>\n                                                        <li>Write macros in Microsoft Office and Nisus Writer Pro</li>\n                                                        <li>Create rules to file email automatically in Apple Mail and Outlook</li>\n                                                        <li>Log in to Web sites faster with a password manager</li>\n                                                        <li>Automate cloud services with IFTTT and Zapier</li>\n                                                        <li>Set up automatic backup and syncing</li>\n                                                        <li>Get started with Automator and AppleScript</li>\n                                                        <li>Control nearly anything on your Mac with Keyboard Maestro</li>\n                                                    </ul><p>This ebook was written for users of 10.9 Mavericks and 10.10 Yosemite, but many of the functions described work similarly in older versions of OS X.</p>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>"],"id":"9781615424368"},{"publisher":" TidBITS Publishing, Inc.","_type":"OreillyItem","ISBN":"978-1-61542-447-4","name":"Take Control of Numbers.

Achieving a great photograph requires thought and preparation, an understanding of the photographic process, and a firm grasp of how light and composition affect a photo. There must be personal involvement and personal expression. There must be experimentation, with the recognition that only a small percentage of experiments end successfully.<br><br>In this book, best-selling author and world-renowned photographer and teacher Bruce Barnbaum explores these seldom-discussed issues by drawing upon his personal experiences and observations from more than 40 years of photographing and teaching. In addition to photographs, Bruce also uses painting, music, and writing, as well as the sciences and even business, to provide pertinent examples of creative thinking. These examples serve as stepping-stones that will lead you to your own heightened ability to see and be creative.<br><br>Creativity is a topic that is almost wholly ignored in formal education because most instructors think that it cannot be taught or learned. To the contrary, Bruce has proven that photographic seeing and creativity can be taught, learned, and improved. This book expands on the ideas that are central to Bruce's method of teaching photography, which he has used in workshops for the past 41 years.<br><br>Included in the book are in-depth discussions on the following topics:<br><br></p>\n                                                    <ul><li>Defining your own unique rhythm and approach as a photographer</li>\n                                                        <li>How to translate the scene in front of you to the final photograph</li>\n                                                        <li>The differences and similarities between how an amateur and a professional approach photography</li>\n                                                        <li>The differences between realism and abstraction, and the possibilities and limitations of each</li>\n                                                        <li>Learning to expand your own seeing and creativity through classes, workshops, and associating with other photographers</li>\n                                                        <li>Why the rules of composition should be ignored</li>\n                                                        <li>How to follow your passion</li>\n                                                        <li>When to listen to the critics and when to ignore them</li>\n                                                    </ul>The book is richly illustrated with over 90 photographs taken by Bruce as well as other photographers.Seeing and creativity are difficult to teach, but not impossible.

Randall is an experienced wilderness photographer, and whether you want to venture into the mountains for once-in-a-lifetime shots of raw nature, or simply hone your landscape photography skills from the safety of your back deck, Randall explains the art, science and craft of creating astounding images.Randall begins by focusing on the art of landscape photography. He describes his three-step process for composing a photograph and shows how good composition is an organic process that begins with rules but ultimately transcends them. Randall then explores the science behind successful landscape photographs, which requires understanding key concepts from geography, optics, vision, and psychology. These concepts include:</p>\n                                                    <ul><li>Understanding how the position of the sun at sunrise and sunset varies throughout the year, which will help you plan when and where to shoot.</li>\n                                                        <li>Understanding optics to predict where rainbows will appear, how polarizers will interact with reflections, and where to find spectacular light.</li>\n                                                        <li>Understanding how to use topographic maps and computerized mapping tools to help you find the most promising shooting locations in the wilderness. </li>\n                                                        <li>Understanding how our visual system analyzes images and the psychology of how we view art.

Eugene Atget documented evidence of everyday life in the streets as well as the buildings and monuments of Paris. Henri Cartier-Bresson pursued what he called \"The Decisive Moment,\" the moment in which the meaning of an event was most clearly captured in a photograph. Their work, and that of many other masters, has inspired generations of photographers to wander public spaces, camera in hand, searching for meaningful moments in time.<br><br>Success requires the street photographer to be proficient with their equipment, to be constantly aware of their surroundings, and to have a keen eye. Quick reflexes and self-confidence are essential: Street photographers know from experience that hesitation or procrastination could mean missing a once-in-a-lifetime shot. The adage \"it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission\" was probably coined by a street photographer. <br><br>In <i>Street Photography: The Art of Capturing the Candid Moment,</i> Gordon Lewis helps readers understand and conquer the challenging yet rewarding world of street photography. The book includes discussions of why photographers are drawn to street photography, the different styles of street photography, and what makes a great street photograph. Lewis then goes on to explore how the choice of location can change a photographer's approach to image capture: from city streets to fairs to beaches, Lewis discusses the impact different environments have on the process of street photography. <br><br>Another crucial element to becoming a good street photographer is learning to travel light, with minimal equipment. Lewis gives readers practical advice on everything from cameras and lenses to camera bags and clothing. Lewis also delves into the techniques and approaches that will help novices master the art of street photography. <br><br>Whether your style is to engage your subjects or to remain unnoticed and take candid portraits, Lewis offers ideas on how to capture fascinating moments in time: a gesture, expression, or composition that may exist for only a fraction of a second, but can leave a lasting impression of the wonders, challenges, and absurdities of modern life.</p>\n                                            </div>"],"id":"9781937538378"},{"publisher":" Rocky Nook","_type":"OreillyItem","ISBN":"978-1-937538-62-0","name":"The Leica M Photographer.

You'll start building and revising a real app that's written entirely in Apple's new Swift programming language.

You will define domain model and map it with database schema using different techniques. You will then look into multiple ways of storing domain entities in a database and learn important concepts such as transitive persistence, transactions and unit of work. This will be followed by retrieving data from database. Next, you will optimize your code, explore concepts such as the onion architecture, and learn where NHibernate fits best in an application's architecture. After introducing a well-known repository pattern into our application, you will learn to deal with legacy databases.

It starts with the basics of storage accounts, which give access to the four basic services the Blob, Table, Queue, and File storage services. These services are exposed through a REST API that makes it possible for client libraries to implement most of their functionality in a wide range of popular programming languages. Emphasizing the Windows Azure Client Library for .NET, we will deal with storing and retrieving unstructured data with Blobs, then will move to Tables to insert and update entities in a structured NoSQL fashion.

She provides hope, wisdom, and perspective for learning the discipline of perseverance.Wheatley does not offer the usual feel-good, rah-rah messages.  Instead, she focuses on the situations, feelings, and challenges that can, over time, cause us to lose heart or lose our way.  Perseverance is a day-by-day decision not to give up.  We have to notice the moments when we feel lost or overwhelmed or betrayed or exhausted and note how we respond to them.  And we have to notice the rewarding times, when we experience the joy of working together on something hard but worthwhile, when we realize we’ve made a small difference. In a series of concise and compassionate essays Wheately names a behavior or dynamic—such as fearlessness, guilt, joy, jealousy—that supports or impedes our efforts to persevere. She puts each in a broader human or timeless perspective, offering ways to either live by or transcend each one. These essays are self-contained—you can thumb through the book and find what attracts you in the moment.   Perseverance helps you to see yourself and your situation clearly and assume responsibility for changing a situation or our reaction to it if it’s one that troubles us. There deliberately are no examples of other people or their experiences. You are the example—your personal experiences are the basis for change.In addition to Wheatley’s graceful essays there are poems and quotations drawn from traditions and cultures around the world and throughout history.  The book is deeply grounded spiritually, accessing human experience and wisdom from many sources. This grounding and inclusiveness support the essential message—human being throughout time have persevered.  We’re just the most recent ones to face these challenges, and we can meet them as those who came before us did. As Wheatley quotes the elders of the Hopi Nation: “We are the ones we have been waiting for.”</p>\n                                            </div>"],"id":"9781605098203"},{"publisher":" Wiley / For Dummies","_type":"OreillyItem","ISBN":"978-1-4571-3210-0","name":"Electronic Health Records For Dummies.

Whenever we do something we wish we hadn’t—or don’t do something we wish we had—we vow it won’t happen again. But why do we have regrets in the first place? Because we become prisoners of habit and circumstance, we take people in our lives for granted and fail to be true to ourselves. We stop growing and learning, become self-absorbed and judgmental, and lose touch with our innate goodness. Inspired by his final conversation with a dying friend, Marc Muchnick’s No More Regrets! is specifically designed to help you avoid these pitfalls.Just one or two of the thirty ways to greater happiness and meaning outlined here could potentially change your life. Muchnick’s suggestions are straightforward, thoughtful, and easy to implement—often just a matter of shifting perspective and seeing the world differently. He illustrates each with a moving personal story and includes a “No More Regrets! Game Plan” tool to help you banish regret from your life forever.</p>\n                                            </div>"],"id":"9781605098869"},{"publisher":" Berrett-Koehler Publishers","_type":"OreillyItem","ISBN":"978-1-60509-863-0","name":"The Power of Your Past.

With our cultural obsession with living in the moment, we neglect to engage in creative reflection on our personal histories. In The Power Of Your Past, John Schuster systematically demonstrates that our pasts are the biggest, most accessible, and most under-utilized of resources for anyone wanting to make positive changes. In contrast to other more technical, spiritual, or therapeutic guides that address working with one's past, he offers a balanced, practical and accessible approach through an actionable three-phase model: Recalling, Reclaiming, and Recasting. He provides exercises that link past events to achieving sounder interpretations and illustrates the process with inspiring histories of those who have experienced transformative results through embracing their own professional and personal pasts.                                                                                Schuster provides insight, encouragement, and steps for essential professional and personal development. Readers who follow this model will make progress in careers short on heart and meaning, overcome obstacles that other methods can't address, and make decisions based on their truth, not the versions of truth they have inherited and not fully examined. They will enjoy the peace of mind that comes with the knowledge that all they need to grow--insight, courage and persistence are the ingredients--is already within.</p>\n                                            </div>"],"id":"9781605098265"},{"publisher":" Berrett-Koehler Publishers","_type":"OreillyItem","ISBN":"978-1-60994-071-3","name":"Prosper.

Is it simply having enough money? Certainly financial security is necessary for peace of mind. But for many people the pursuit of money stresses and exhausts them so much, it makes peace of mind impossible. And they’re always chasing after more—they never feel like they have enough.True prosperity is when there is no conflict between money and happiness—when you don’t have to drag yourself out of bed every morning because the way you make a living is true to who you are. And when your way of life is sustainable, you don’t fall victim to the boom/crash syndrome that afflicts so many people because you know exactly what you need to be happy and have a plan to achieve it.For the past twelve years Ethan Willis and Randy Garn have helped tens of thousands of people find their own personal path to prosperity. After nearly 11 million hours of personal coaching observation in eighty countries, they’ve developed six Prosperity Practices that will enable you to create a life that is rich, rewarding, and renewing.You begin by focusing on what you have, not on what you do not—you’ll be sur- prised what you find once you shift your way of thinking. A key part of this process is determining what Willis and Garn call your “Polaris Point”: a precise description of the life you want and what you need to sustain it. This becomes your own private North Star, guiding all your actions and keeping you from chasing after things you don’t really want or need. Then you’ll discover how to leverage your passions, experi- ence, and expertise to generate the income you require to reach your Polaris Point.Although you’ll find much to reflect on here, Prosper is an action guide—at the end of each chapter, Willis and Garn provide concrete steps you can take to make each of the Prosperity Practices a reality. Soon your life will be aligned with the core of your being, you will have a deep understanding of what you need to be happy, and you’ll know how to hold to that vision—and you will truly prosper.</p>\n                                            </div>"],"id":"9781609940706"},{"publisher":" O'Reilly Media","_type":"OreillyItem","ISBN":"978-1-4493-0502-4","name":"Hacking Healthcare.

Jaworski came to realize that traditional analytical leadership approaches are inadequate for dealing creatively with this complexity. To effectively face these challenges, leaders need to access the Source from which truly profound innovation flows. Many people, including Jaworski himself, have experienced a connection with this Source, often when called upon to respond in times of crisis—moments of extreme spontaneity and intuitive insight. Actions simply flow through them, seemingly without any sort of conscious intervention. But these experiences are chance occurrences—ordinarily, we don’t know how to access the Source, and we even have a blind spot as to its very existence. In an extraordinarily wide-ranging intellectual odyssey, Jaworski relates his fascinating experiences with quantum physicists, cognitive scientists, indigenous leaders, and spiritual thinkers, all focused on getting to the heart of the Source. Ultimately, he develops four guiding principles that encompass the nature of the Source and what we need to do to stay in dynamic dialogue with it.Using the combination of narrative and reflection that made Synchronicity so compelling, Jaworski has written a book that illuminates the essential nature not only of visionary leadership but also of relationships, consciousness, and ultimately reality itself.</p>\n                                            </div>"],"id":"9781576759042"},{"publisher":" Berrett-Koehler Publishers","_type":"OreillyItem","ISBN":"978-1-60994-293-9","name":"Being Buddha at Work. 108 Ancient Truths on Change, Stress, Money, and Success","author":"","cover":"http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/9781609942922/cat.gif","page_number":"172","year":"2012","short_description":["<div>\n                                                <p>Buddhism has for thousands of years provided a spiritual foundation for the daily lives of millions of people around the world.

And that’s just as true at work as at home.Buddha mind—a source of calm, compassion, and insight—exists within each of us, not just the historical Buddha. Being Buddha at Work shows how to embody that mind in the stress and clamor of the workplace—how to tap into the Buddha consciousness so we can relieve daily tensions and greet challenges with awareness, equanimity, and good humor. The book is divided into three sections. The first, “Becoming a Mindful Worker,” covers Buddha’s wisdom for our own work; the second, “Cultivating Mindful Work Relationships,” focuses on how to work with other people; the third, “Creating a Mindful Workplace,” deals with broader organizational topics.

Best Care Anywhere shows that vast swaths of what we think we know about health, health care, and medical economics are just plain wrong. And the book demonstrates how this extraordinarily cost-effective model, which has proven to be highly popular with veterans, can be made available to everyone. New to this edition is an analysis of how the shortcomings of both so-called Obamacare and Republican plans to privatize Medicare reinforce the need for applying the lessons of the VA. Also included are completely updated statistics and research, as well as examples of how the private sector is already beginning to learn from the VA’s example.</p>\n                                            </div>"],"id":"9781609945176"},{"publisher":" O'Reilly Media","_type":"OreillyItem","ISBN":"978-1-4493-1656-3","name":"Enabling Programmable Self with HealthVault.

But the physical aspects barely scratch the surface of yoga’s transformative powers. The poses are only one part of a larger philosophy offering profound insights for confronting the complexities of daily life. Yoga can help you remain centered, compassionate, positive, and sane every hour of the day—especially those between nine and five.

But beyond that, this book is an invitation to use all of yoga’s teachings to cultivate the spark of the divine that dwells within each of us. “Filled with personal insights and stories that carry yoga into the world of daily decision making.… It is wonderful to see the foundations of practice brought to life in such a confident, sincere, and thoughtful way.”—Pandit Rajmani Tuganait, Chairman and spiritual head of the Himalayan Institute“Maren and Jamie show that yoga is not just about poses—the practice is about creating the stillness of mind that will allow you do the work you were meant to do.

Despite all your good intentions, though, somehow it never quite goes according to plan. But you can break that cycle.In Fit at Last, bestselling business author Ken Blanchard and fitness authority Tim Kearin show how Ken, at age seventy-three, finally was able to make lasting improvements in his health and fitness, including dropping over thirty pounds in a year. In each chapter, Ken shares the very personal story of his ups and downs—involving, among other things, a puppy, a Hawaiian tour bus full of widows, and a fifty-year college reunion—while Tim offers expert advice and wisdom gained from over forty years in the fitness industry.Following through on your efforts to get fit requires leadership—personal leadership. Early on, Ken realized the same concepts he’d been using for years to help people lead organizations also could help him stick to his program. Here, you’ll learn how Ken and Tim applied the Situational Leadership II approach to set SMART goals, diagnose Ken’s progress in each of the six core areas of fitness, and match them with the leadership styles necessary to get Ken to the next level in each area. Certainly there is a wealth of excellent fitness advice here—but ultimately, this is a book about commitment. People don’t fail because they don’t know what to do—they fail because they just don’t do it.

Formal Verification (FV) enables a designer to directly analyze and mathematically explore the quality or other aspects of a Register Transfer Level (RTL) design without using simulations. This can reduce time spent validating designs and more quickly reach a final design for manufacturing. Building on a basic knowledge of SystemVerilog, this book demystifies FV and presents the practical applications that are bringing it into mainstream design and validation processes at Intel and other companies. After reading this book, readers will be prepared to introduce FV in their organization and effectively deploy FV techniques to increase design and validation productivity.</p>\n                                                    <p>\n                                                        <br><br></p>\n                                                    <ul><li>Learn formal verification algorithms to gain full coverage without exhaustive simulation</li>\n                                                        <li>Understand formal verification tools and how they differ from simulation tools</li>\n                                                        <li>Create instant test benches to gain insight into how models work and find initial bugs</li>\n                                                        <li>Learn from Intel insiders sharing their hard-won knowledge and solutions to complex design problems</li>\n                                                    </ul></div>\n                                            </div>"],"id":"9780128007273"},{"publisher":" Elsevier / Morgan Kaufmann","_type":"OreillyItem","ISBN":"978-0-12-802646-5","name":"Emerging Trends in Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, and Systems Biology.

We will then walk through built-in templates, themes, and headers, before creating an Ionic list, rendering data for it, and taking a look at creating services to manage our data efficiently.</p>\n                                                    <p>Next, we start to incorporate greater sophistication by adding elements such as infinite scroll and pull-to-refresh, implementing data persistence, and focus on generally enhancing the user experience. Finally, we will talk about deploying our application to an emulator for testing purposes, and discuss Cordova plugins that can add even more functionality. By the end of the video you will have developed a full-featured, multi-platform mobile Ionic application.</p>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>"],"id":"0636920046165"},{"publisher":" Packt Publishing","_type":"OreillyItem","ISBN":"978-1-78398-739-9","name":"Kivy Cookbook.

This book begins by taking you through the process of forensic investigation and the pitfalls to avoid. It will walk you through Hadoop's internals and architecture, and you will discover what types of information Hadoop stores and how to access that data. You will learn to identify Big Data evidence using techniques to survey a live system and interview witnesses. After setting up your own Hadoop system, you will collect evidence using techniques such as forensic imaging and application-based extractions. You will analyze Hadoop evidence using advanced tools and techniques to uncover events and statistical information. Finally, data visualization and evidence presentation techniques are covered to help you properly communicate your findings to any audience.</p>\n                                                    <h2>Style and approach</h2>\n                                                    <p>This book is a complete guide that follows every step of the forensic analysis process in detail.

In order to provide effective services and to make smarter and more intelligent decisions from these huge volumes of data, enterprises use big-data analytics. In recent years, Hadoop has been used for massive data storage and efficient distributed processing of data. The Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN) framework solves the design problems related to resource management faced by the Hadoop 1.x framework by providing a more scalable, efficient, flexible, and highly available resource management framework for distributed data processing.</p>\n                                                    <p>This book starts with an overview of the YARN features and explains how YARN provides a business solution for growing big data needs. You will learn to provision and manage single, as well as multi-node, Hadoop-YARN clusters in the easiest way. You will walk through the YARN administration, life cycle management, application execution, REST APIs, schedulers, security framework and so on. You will gain insights about the YARN components and features such as ResourceManager, NodeManager, ApplicationMaster, Container, Timeline Server, High Availability, Resource Localisation and so on.</p>\n                                                    <p>The book explains Hadoop-YARN commands and the configurations of components and explores topics such as High Availability, Resource Localization and Log aggregation. You will then be ready to develop your own ApplicationMaster and execute it over a Hadoop-YARN cluster.</p>\n                                                    <p>Towards the end of the book, you will learn about the security architecture and integration of YARN with big data technologies like Spark and Storm.

Learning to Succeed insists that an integrated model for corporate education--one that links development programs with strategic goals--is critical to building agile and resilient learning organizations that will survive in our fast-evolving business landscape. Companies need to continually assess where they need to go in relation to where they are now--and use training to bridge the gap. As these new education initiatives are designed to advance concrete corporate goals, participants become active learners. Instead of merely listening to lectures--they work on strategic plans and action projects tied to key objectives. Learning is reinforced and ROI is optimized. For companies ready to embrace what it means to be a learning organization, to welcome the CLO to the C-Suite, to tightly and continuously weave strategy and learning into the fabric of their businesses, the opportunities are limitless.

But there's hope. The nine software development practices in <i>Beyond Legacy Code</i> are designed to solve the problems facing our industry. Discover <i>why</i> these practices work, not just <i>how</i> they work, and dramatically increase the quality and maintainability of any software project.<br><br>These nine practices could save the software industry. <i>Beyond Legacy Code</i> is filled with practical, hands-on advice and a common-sense exploration of why technical practices such as refactoring and test-first development are critical to building maintainable software. Discover how to avoid the pitfalls teams encounter when adopting these practices, and how to dramatically reduce the risk associated with building software--realizing significant savings in both the short and long term. With a deeper understanding of the principles behind the practices, you'll build software that's easier and less costly to maintain and extend.<br><br>By adopting these nine key technical practices, you'll learn to say what, why, and for whom before how; build in small batches; integrate continuously; collaborate; create CLEAN code; write the test first; specify behaviors with tests; implement the design last; and refactor legacy code.<br><br>Software developers will find hands-on, pragmatic advice for writing higher quality, more maintainable, and bug-free code. Managers, customers, and product owners will gain deeper insight into vital processes. By moving beyond the old-fashioned procedural thinking of the Industrial Revolution, and working together to embrace standards and practices that will advance software development, we can turn the legacy code crisis into a true Information Revolution.</p>\n                                            </div>"],"id":"9781680500790"},{"publisher":" Packt Publishing","_type":"OreillyItem","ISBN":"978-1-78439-730-2","name":"Neo4j Graph Data Modeling.

Obsessed with the idea of getting computer power into their own hands, they launched from their garages a hobbyist movement that grew into an industry, and ultimately a social and technological revolution. What they did was invent the personal computer: not just a new device, but a watershed in the relationship between man and machine. This is their story.<br><br><i>Fire in the Valley</i> is the definitive history of the personal computer, drawn from interviews with the people who made it happen, written by two veteran computer writers who were there from the start. Working at <i>InfoWorld</i> in the early 1980s, Swaine and Freiberger daily rubbed elbows with people like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates when they were creating the personal computer revolution.<br><br>A rich story of colorful individuals, <i>Fire in the Valley</i> profiles these unlikely revolutionaries and entrepreneurs, such as Ed Roberts of MITS, Lee Felsenstein at Processor Technology, and Jack Tramiel of Commodore, as well as Jobs and Gates in all the innocence of their formative years.<br><br>This completely revised and expanded third edition brings the story to its completion, chronicling the end of the personal computer revolution and the beginning of the post-PC era. It covers the departure from the stage of major players with the deaths of Steve Jobs and Douglas Engelbart and the retirements of Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer; the shift away from the PC to the cloud and portable devices; and what the end of the PC era means for issues such as personal freedom and power, and open source vs. proprietary software.</p>\n                                            </div>"],"id":"9781937785765"},{"publisher":" O'Reilly Media","_type":"OreillyItem","ISBN":null,"name":"Velocity Conference New York 2014: Complete Video Compilation.
